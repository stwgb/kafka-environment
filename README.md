# Kafka-Environment

The Kafka-Environment is a project I have created during the kafka courses by 
[stephane maarek](https://www.udemy.com/user/stephane-maarek/) on udemy.

The heart of the project is [kafka-messaging](kafka-messaging) and consists of

 - zookeeper,
 - kafka-brokers and
 - kafka-connect.

To administrate and get insights to the kafka-broker and zookeeper there is an [administration section](administration)
with

  - [zooNavigator](https://github.com/elkozmon/zoonavigator) and
  - [CMAK (Kafka-Manager)](https://github.com/yahoo/CMAK).
  
For the [monitoring](monitoring) of the cluster

  - [prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) and
  - [grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) and used.
  
As reminder there are also some notes to [avro](avro/avro.md).
